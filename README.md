# 🔍 Unsupervised Learning: Clustering & Pattern Discovery

This repository documents my deep dive into **Unsupervised Learning**, focusing on identifying hidden structures and groupings within unlabeled data.

## 📅 Day 16: K-Means Clustering & Iris Analysis
I kicked off the Unsupervised chapter by mastering centroid-based clustering.

* **K-Means Implementation**: Partitioned data into $K$ distinct clusters where points belong to the nearest mean.
* **The Elbow Method**: Used WCSS (Within-Cluster Sum of Squares) visualization to mathematically determine the optimal cluster count.
* **Iris Dataset**: Validated unsupervised clusters against known species labels to measure model performance.

## 📅 Day 17: Hierarchical Clustering & DBSCAN
Today, I explored density and connectivity-based algorithms to handle complex data shapes.

### 1. Hierarchical (Agglomerative) Clustering
* **Concept**: A "bottom-up" approach where data points are merged into a tree-like structure based on proximity.
* **Dendrogram Analysis**: Used hierarchical trees to visualize merges and decide where to "cut" the tree for optimal clusters.

### 2. DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering)
* **Concept**: Groups points based on high-density regions, making it robust to non-spherical shapes.
* **Noise Detection**: Unlike K-Means, DBSCAN effectively identifies and labels outliers (noise) that don't fit into any cluster.
